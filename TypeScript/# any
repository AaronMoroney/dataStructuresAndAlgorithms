# any keyword

- in a situation where we declare a variable, and assign it to no value, the programme will infer it with an `any`  type automatically
- this can lead to significant bugs
- any is not a specific type, any basically turns off the typescript

```typescript
let hero; //automatically inferred with 'any'

function getHero() {
    return true
}

hero = getHero(); 
//this would break the consistancy of the code

let tutor: string; //explicitly inferred with type 'string'

function getTutor() {
    //return 'timur' //works
    return 5 //breaks the code
}

tutor = getTutor(); 
//type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
- noImplicitAny, can be added in the TS.config file that will allow us to not fall into this trap.
