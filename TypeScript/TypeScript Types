# TypeScript Alias

```typescript
type user = {
    name: string,
    email: string,
    isActive: boolean
}
```
- why would you rename?

```typescript
type myString = string; //this is technically allowed..
```

- the advantage of creating a type, is the we can pass this on to the methods we use
- all our methiods should adhere to the same type

```typescript
function createUser(user: User): User { //: User is the return type
    return {name: "", email: "", isActive: true};
}
```
