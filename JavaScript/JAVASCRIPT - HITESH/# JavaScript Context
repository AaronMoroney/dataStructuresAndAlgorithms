# JavaScript - Context

- why does the following code work?

``` javascript
sayHello();

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
```

``` javascript
if (2 === "2") {
    console.log("This is true");
}
var myName = "Hitesh";
if (myName === window.myName) {
    console.log("This is again a true statement"); //this will throw an error in a node environment
}
if (myName === window.myName) {
    console.log("This is again a true statement"); //but this will run in a browser
}
```

- There is always a global context in JavaScript
- In a browser, the global context is the window object
- the context registers all the functions and variables that are defined in it
- they are wrapped up and put into the global context
