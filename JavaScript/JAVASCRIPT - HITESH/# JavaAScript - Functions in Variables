# JavaScript - Functions in Variables

Define a function that can answer the role of a user.

A user can be on following roles:
admin - with all access
subadmin - with access to create/delete courses
testprep - with access to create/delete tests
user - consume all content
other - trial user

```javascript

function getUserRole(name, role) {
    switch (role) {
        case "admin":
            return `${name} is admin with all access`;
            break; //break is not necessary here
        case "subadmin":
            return `${name} is subadmin with access to create/delete courses`;
            break;
        case "testprep":
            return `${name} is testprep with access to create/delete tests`;
            break;
        case "user":
            return `${name} is user to consume all content`;
            break;
        default:
            return `${name} is a trial user`;
        break;
    }
}

getUser("Hitesh", "admin"); //doesnt print anything
let getRole = getUserRole("Hitesh", "admin"); //Hitesh is admin with all access

let getRole = getUserRole("Hitesh", "testprep"); //Hitesh is testprep with access to create/delete tests
console.log(getRole);
```
- We can declare a variable, and assign a function to it.

```javascript
let getUserRole = function(name, role) {
    switch (role) {
        case "admin":
            return `${name} is admin with all access`;
            break; //break is not necessary here
        case "subadmin":
            return `${name} is subadmin with access to create/delete courses`;
            break;
        case "testprep":
            return `${name} is testprep with access to create/delete tests`;
            break;
        case "user":
            return `${name} is user to consume all content`;
            break;
        default:
            return `${name} is a trial user`;
        break;
    }
}

let getUserRole = (name, role) => {
    switch (role) {
        case "admin":
            return `${name} is admin with all access`;
            break; //break is not necessary here
        case "subadmin":
            return `${name} is subadmin with access to create/delete courses`;
            break;
        case "testprep":
            return `${name} is testprep with access to create/delete tests`;
            break;
        case "user":
            return `${name} is user to consume all content`;
            break;
        default:
            return `${name} is a trial user`;
        break;
    }
}

```
