    e.g write a function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum

    function sum(x,y) {
        return x += y;
    }
    console.log(sum(1,2));

    ======================
    20. Understand the problem
    ======================

    -- 1. can I restate the problem in my own words?
    ** 'implement addition'

    -- 2. what are the inputs that go into the problem?
    **  are the numbers floating points?
    **  is there a mathmatical upper bound in this programming langauge

    -- 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
    ** int
    ** floating point
    ** strings
   
    -- 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do i have enough info?
    ** what happens if someone only passes in only one number?
    
    -- 5. how should i label the important pieces of info?
    ** function name, inputs (x,y), store result in variable?

    ======================
    21. concrete examples
    ======================

    //Write a function which takes in a string & returns counts of each char in string

    eg FN: charCount('aaaa') // {a:4}
    eg FN: charCount('hello') // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1 }

    --1. Start w/ simple examples
    --2. Progress to more complex examples
    --3. Explore examples w/ empty inputs
    --4. Explore examples w/ imnvalid inputs 

    does our code need to contain a count of charecotrs not present?
    what about other charectors, whitespaces, casing?
    what about empty inputs?
